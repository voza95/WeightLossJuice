<div style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px;"><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="font-size: 18.6667px; text-align: justify;"><h2><font size="3" color="#000000">1. Write down what you eat for one week and you will lose weight.</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">Studies found that people who keep food diaries wind up eating about 
15 percent less food than those who don’t. Watch out for weekends: A 
University of North Carolina study found people tend to consume an extra
 115 calories per weekend day, primarily from alcohol and fat. Then cut out or down calories from spreads, dressings, sauces, 
condiments, drinks, and snacks; they could make the difference between 
weight gain and loss. <br></font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">2. Add 10 percent to the amount of daily calories you think you’re eating</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">If you think you’re consuming 1,700 calories a day and don’t 
understand why you’re not losing weight, add another 170 calories to 
your guesstimate. Chances are, the new number is more accurate. Adjust 
your eating habits accordingly. For instance, your cup of coffee might have more calories than you thought.</font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">3. Get an online weight loss buddy to lose more weight</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">A University of Vermont study found that online weight-loss buddies 
help you keep the weight off. The researchers followed volunteers for 18
 months. Those assigned to an Internet-based weight maintenance program 
sustained their weight loss better than those who met face-to-face in a 
support group. <br></font></p>

<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">4. Get a weight-loss mantra</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">You’ve heard of a self-fulfilling prophecy? If you keep focusing on 
things you can’t do, like resisting junk food or getting out the door 
for a daily walk, chances are you won’t do them. Instead (whether you 
believe it or not) repeat positive thoughts to yourself. “I can lose 
weight.” “I will get out for my walk today.” “I know I can resist the 
pastry cart after dinner.” Repeat these phrases and before too long, 
they will become true for you. <br><span class="credits-overlay"></span></font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">5. After breakfast, stick to water</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">At breakfast, go ahead and drink orange juice. But throughout the 
rest of the day, focus on water instead of juice or soda. The average 
American consumes an extra 245 calories a day from soft drinks. That’s 
nearly 90,000 calories a year—or 25 pounds! And research shows that 
despite the calories, sugary drinks don’t trigger a sense of fullness 
the way that food does. <br></font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">6. Eat three fewer bites of your meal</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">…or one less treat a day, or one less glass of orange juice. Doing 
any of these can save you about 100 calories a day, and that alone is 
enough to prevent you from gaining the two pounds most people mindlessly
 pack on each year. <br></font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">7. Watch one less hour of TV</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">A study of 76 undergraduate students found the more they watched 
television, the more often they ate and the more they ate overall. 
Sacrifice one program (there’s probably one you don’t really want to 
watch anyway) and go for a walk instead—in even just 15 minutes, you’ll 
reap amazing benefits of walking. <br></font></p>		
		
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">8. Wash something thoroughly once a week</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">Whether that’s a floor, a couple of windows, the shower stall, bathroom tile, your car, or one of these everyday items no one cleans enough,
 a 150-pound person will burn about four calories for every minute spent
 cleaning. Scrub for 30 minutes and you could work off approximately 120
 calories, the same number in a half-cup of vanilla frozen yogurt. <br></font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000"><strong>9. Wait until your stomach rumbles before you reach for food</strong></font></h2>
<p><font size="3">It’s stunning how often we eat out of boredom, nervousness, habit, or
 frustration—so often, in fact, that many of us have actually forgotten 
what physical hunger feels like. If you’re hankering for a specific food, it’s probably a craving, not 
hunger. If you’d eat anything you could get your hands on, chances are 
you’re truly hungry. But talk to your doctor if you think you’re always hungry for a medical reason.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3"><span class="credits-overlay"></span></font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">10. Sniff a banana, an apple, or a peppermint when you feel hungry<strong><br>
</strong></font></h2>
<p><font size="3">You might feel silly, but it works. When Alan R. Hirsch, MD, 
neurological director of the Smell &amp; Taste Treatment and Research 
Foundation in Chicago, tried this with 3,000 volunteers, he found that 
the more frequently people sniffed, the less hungry they were and the 
more weight they lost—an average of 30 pounds each. One theory is that 
sniffing the food tricks the brain into thinking you’re actually eating 
it.<br></font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000"><strong>11. Stare at the color blue</strong></font></h2>
<p><font size="3">There’s a good reason you won’t see many fast-food restaurants 
decorated in blue: it functions as an appetite suppressant. So serve up 
dinner on blue plates, dress in blue while you eat, and cover your table
 with a blue tablecloth. Conversely, avoid red, yellow, and orange in 
your dining areas. Studies find they encourage eating. <br></font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">12. Eat in front of mirrors and you’ll lose weight</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">One study found that eating in front of mirrors slashed the amount 
people ate by nearly one-third. Having to look yourself in the eye 
reflects back some of your own inner standards and goals, and reminds 
you of why you’re trying to lose weight in the first place.<br></font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">13. Spend 10 minutes a day walking up and down stairs</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">The Centers for Disease Control says that’s all it takes to help you 
shed as much as 10 pounds a year (assuming you don’t start eating more). <br></font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">14. Walk five minutes for at least every two hours</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">Stuck at a desk all day? A brisk five-minute walk every two hours 
will parlay into an extra 20-minute walk by the end of the day, and getting moving is more beneficial than a standing desk. Plus,&nbsp;getting a break will make you less likely to reach for snacks out of antsiness. <br></font></p>		
		

<p><font size="3"><span class="credits-overlay"></span></font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">15. You’ll lose weight and fat if you walk 45 minutes a day, not 30</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">The reason we’re suggesting 45 minutes instead of the typical 30 is 
that a Duke University study found that while 30 minutes of daily 
walking is enough to prevent weight gain in most relatively sedentary 
people, exercise beyond 30 minutes results in weight and fat loss. 
Burning an additional 300 calories a day with three miles of brisk 
walking (45 minutes should do it) could help you lose 30 pounds in a 
year without even changing how much you’re eating.<br></font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">16. Don’t buy any prepared food</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">… that lists sugar, fructose, or corn syrup among the first four 
ingredients on the label. You should be able to find a lower-sugar 
version of the same type of food. If you can’t, grab a piece of fruit 
instead, especially if you show signs you’re eating too much sugar. Look for sugar-free varieties of foods such as ketchup, mayonnaise, salad dressing, and other&nbsp;foods with&nbsp;way more sugar than you realize.
 Also, avoid partially hydrogenated foods, and look for more than two 
grams of fiber per 100 calories in all grain products. Finally, a short 
ingredient list means fewer flavor enhancers and empty calories.</font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">17. Put your fork or spoon down between every bite</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">At the table, sip water frequently. Intersperse your eating with 
stories for your dining partner of the amusing things that happened 
during your day. Your brain lags your stomach by about 20 minutes when 
it comes to satiety (fullness) signals. If you eat slowly enough, your 
brain will catch up to tell you that you are no longer in need of food. <br></font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">18. Throw out your “fat” clothes for good</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">Once you’ve started losing weight, throw out or give away every piece of clothing that doesn’t fit, and fill your closet with a dress that shows off your favorite body part. The idea of having to buy a whole new wardrobe if you gain the weight back will serve as a strong incentive to stay fit.</font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">19. Close the kitchen for 12 hours</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">After dinner, wash all the dishes, wipe down the counters, turn out 
the light, and, if necessary, tape closed the cabinets and refrigerator.
 Late-evening eating significantly increases the overall number of 
calories you eat, a University of Texas study found.<br></font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">20. Walk before dinner and you’ll cut calories AND your appetite</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">In a study of ten&nbsp;obese women conducted at the University of Glasgow 
in Scotland, 20 minutes of walking reduced appetite and increased 
sensations of fullness as effectively as a light meal.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><span class="credits-overlay"></span></font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">21. Make one social outing this week an active one</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">Pass on the movies and screen the views of a local park instead. Not 
only will you sit less, but you’ll be saving calories because you won’t 
chow down on that bucket of popcorn. Other active ideas: a tennis match,
 a guided nature or city walk (check your local listings), a bike ride, 
bowling ...<br></font></p>		
		
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">22. Hook on a&nbsp;step tracker, and aim for an extra 1,000 steps a day</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">Are you showing signs you need to move more?
 On average, sedentary people take only 2,000 to 3,000 steps a day. 
Adding 2,000 steps will help you maintain your current weight and stop 
gaining weight; adding more than that will help you lose weight.</font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">23. Put less food out and you’ll take less in</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">Conversely, the more food in front of you, the more you’ll 
eat—regardless of how hungry you are. So instead of using regular dinner
 plates that range these days from 10 to 14 inches (making them look 
empty if they’re not heaped with food), serve your main course on salad 
plates (about 7 to 9 inches wide). Instead of 16-ounce glasses and 
oversized coffee mugs, return to the old days of 8-ounce glasses and 
6-ounce coffee cups.<br></font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000"><strong>24. Eat 90 percent of your meals at home</strong></font></h2>
<p><font size="3">You’re more likely to eat more—and eat more high-fat, high-calorie 
foods—when you eat out than when you eat at home. Restaurants today 
serve such large portions that many have switched to larger plates and 
tables to accommodate them. You’ll gasp when you see just how bad the unhealthiest restaurant meals in America are. <br></font></p>


<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">25. Serve food on your plate instead of on platters</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">If you eat your dinner restaurant style on your plate rather than 
family style, helping yourself from bowls and platters on the table, 
you’ll lose weight. Most of us tend to eat an average of 150 percent 
more calories in the evening than in the morning. You’ll avoid that now 
because when your plate is empty, you’re finished; there’s no reaching 
for seconds.</font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">26. Don’t eat with a large group</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">A study published in the <em>Journal of Physiological Behavior</em> 
found that we tend to eat more when we eat with other people, most 
likely because we spend more time at the table. But eating with your 
significant other or your family, and using table time for talking in 
between chewing, can help cut down on calories. <br></font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">27. Order the smallest portion of everything</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">If you’re out and ordering a sub, get the six-inch sandwich. Buy a 
small popcorn, a small salad, a small hamburger. Again, studies find we 
tend to eat what’s in front of us, even though we’d feel just as full on
 less. <br></font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">28. Eat water-rich foods and you’ll eat fewer calories overall</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">A body of research out of Pennsylvania State University finds that 
eating water-rich foods such as zucchini, tomatoes, and cucumbers during
 meals reduces your overall calorie consumption. Other water-rich foods 
include soups and salads. You won’t get the same benefits by just 
drinking your water, though.
 Because the body processes hunger and thirst through different 
mechanisms, it simply doesn’t register a sense of fullness with water 
(or soda, tea, coffee, or juice).</font></p>		
		
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">29. Bulk up your meals with veggies</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">You can eat twice as much pasta salad loaded with veggies like 
broccoli, carrots, and tomatoes for the same calories as a pasta salad 
sporting just mayonnaise. Same goes for stir-fries, omelets, and other 
veggie-friendly dishes. If you eat a 1:1 ratio of grains to veggies, the
 high-fiber veggies will help satisfy your hunger before you overeat the
 grains. Bonus: Fiber is highly beneficial for preventing constipation, which can make you look bloated.<br></font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">30. Avoid white foods</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">There is some scientific legitimacy to today’s lower-carb diets: 
Large amounts of simple carbohydrates from white flour and added sugar 
can wreak havoc on your blood sugar and lead to weight gain. While 
avoiding sugar, white rice, and white flour, however, you should eat 
plenty of whole-grain breads and brown rice. One Harvard study of 74,000
 women found that those who ate more than two daily servings of whole 
grains were 49 percent less likely to be overweight than those who ate 
the white stuff. <br></font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">31. Switch to ordinary coffee</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">Fancy coffee drinks from trendy coffee joints often pack several 
hundred calories, thanks to whole milk, whipped cream, sugar, and sugary
 syrups. A cup of regular coffee with skim milk has just a small 
fraction of those calories. And when brewed with good beans, it tastes 
just as great. You can also try nonfat powdered milk in coffee. You’ll 
get the nutritional benefits of skim milk, which is high in calcium and 
low in calories. And, because the water has been removed, powdered milk 
doesn’t dilute the coffee the way skim milk does.</font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">32. If you’re going to indulge, choose fat-releasing foods</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">They should help keep you from feeling deprived and bingeing on 
higher-calorie foods. For instance: honey has just 64 fat-releasing 
calories in one tablespoon. Eggs have just 70 calories in one 
hard-boiled egg, loaded with fat-releasing protein. Part-skim ricotta 
cheese has just 39 calories in one ounce, packed with fat-releasing 
calcium. Dark chocolate has about 168 calories in a one-ounce square, 
but it’s packed with fat releasers. And a University of Tennessee study 
found that people who cut 500 calories a day and ate yogurt three times a
 day for 12 weeks lost more weight and body fat than a group that only 
cut the calories. The researchers concluded that the calcium in low-fat 
dairy foods triggers a hormonal response that inhibits the body’s 
production of fat cells and boosts the breakdown of fat.</font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">33. Enjoy high-calorie treats as the accent, not the centerpiece</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">Eating dessert every day can be good for you,
 as long as you don’t overdo it. Make a spoonful of ice cream the jewel 
and a bowl of fruit the crown. Cut down on the chips by pairing each 
bite with lots of chunky, filling fresh salsa, suggests Jeff Novick, 
director of nutrition at the Pritikin Longevity Center &amp; Spa in 
Florida. Balance a little cheese with a lot of fruit or salad.</font></p>		
		
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">34. Eat cereal for breakfast five days a week</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">Studies find that people who eat cereal for breakfast every day are 
significantly less likely to be obese and have diabetes than those who 
don’t. They also consume more fiber and calcium—and less fat—than those 
who eat other breakfast foods. Make oatmeal, or pour out a high-fiber, 
low-sugar cereal like Total or Grape Nuts, and boost it up with healthy cereal hacks.</font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">35. Try hot sauce, salsa, and Cajun seasonings</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">They provide lots of flavor with no fat and few calories, plus they 
turn up your digestive fires, causing your body to temporarily burn more
 calories. Choose them over butter and creamy or sugary sauces.</font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">36. Eat fruit instead of drinking fruit juice</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">For the calories in one kid-size box of apple juice, you can enjoy an
 apple, orange, and a slice of watermelon. These whole foods will keep 
you satisfied much longer than that box of apple juice, so you’ll eat 
less overall. <br></font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">37. Drop your milk type and you cut calories by about 20 percent</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">If you drink regular, go to 2%. If you already drink 2%, go down 
another notch to 1% or skim milk. Each step downward cuts the calories 
by about 20 percent. Once you train your taste buds to enjoy skim milk, 
you’ll have cut the calories in the whole milk by about half and trimmed
 the fat by more than 95 percent. <br></font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">38. Snack on a small handful of nuts</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">Studies have found that overweight people who ate a moderate-fat diet
 containing almonds lost more weight than a control group that didn’t 
eat nuts. Snacking once or twice a day helps stave off hunger and keeps 
your metabolism stoked. You can also pack up baby carrots, plus raisins, seeds, and dried fruit.<br></font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">39. Get most of your calories before noon</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">Studies find that the more you eat in the morning, the less you’ll 
eat in the evening. And you have more opportunities to burn off those 
early-day calories than you do to burn off dinner calories. Just don’t 
make healthy breakfast mistakes that can ruin your good intentions.</font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">40. Brush your teeth after every meal, especially dinner</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">That clean, minty freshness will serve as a cue to your body and brain that mealtime is over.<br></font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">41. Serve food in courses</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">Instead of piling everything on one plate, bring food to the table in
 individual courses. For the first two courses, bring out soup or 
veggies such as a green salad or the most filling fruits and vegetables.
 By the time you get to the more calorie-dense foods, like meat and 
dessert, you’ll be eating less or may already be full. Nothing wrong 
with leftovers!</font></p>
<h2><font size="3" color="#000000">42. Don’t pour dressing</font></h2>
<p><font size="3">You already know to get your dressing on the side because restaurants tend to drown salads with too much.
 But instead of pouring it on or even dipping the leaves in, do the 
“fork dip.” Stick the tongs of an empty fork into the dish of dressing 
before skewering any salad. You’ll be surprised by how much flavor 
you’ll get, but with way fewer calories.</font></p></div></div></div>
