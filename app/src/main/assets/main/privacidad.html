process certain information obtained from the device where it has been 
installed. This information enables us to improve the app, to optimally 
tailor the content to each user, or to contact the user if necessary. In
 order to make our concern for our users’ privacy clear, we have adopted
 this Privacy Policy which explains in a simple and comprehensible 
language the manner in which we collect, store, use and disclose the 
information users entrust us with.<br>
<br>
These Privacy Policies attempt to cover the widest possible range of 
scenarios, including many cases in which the app does not even collect 
nor process the information described within these Privacy Policies.<br>
<br>
<br>
</font></h3><h3><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">1. What information does the app collect?</font></h3><h3><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">
This application collects the necessary information for the normal 
functioning of our business. Under no circumstance do we collect 
personal information that is unrelated to the activity we perform.<br>
<br>
The app does not collect the user’s personal information, such as his 
name or phone number, except at certain times when the app requests such
 information and the user freely enters it, accepting its submission. 
The app may collect an e-mail address and store it in order to contact 
the user if so necessary.<br>
<br>
<br>
</font></h3><h3><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">2. What information does this privacy policy cover?</font></h3><h3><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">
The App may collect two types of information: (1) non-personal, 
anonymous information collected automatically, or (2) personally 
identifiable information (PII) collected manually after receiving the 
user’s consent.
<br>
<br>
<u>Non-personal information collected automatically</u><br>
<br>
Technical information, which includes certain information or 
characteristics regarding the operating system, including the type of 
ISP or the type of browser used, the Internet Protocol (IP), the IP 
address and the names and versions of the applications installed on the 
device, as well as the geographical location of the device. Technical 
information such as the foregoing stays anonymous; in other words, it 
does not personally identify you or is stored together with any other 
information that may link it to the user itself, except when the user 
submits additional information voluntarily.<br>
<br>
This information shall be used to improve the application, learning how, when and where the user browses on it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>Information freely provided by the user</u><br>
<br>
If at any moment the app were to request Personally Identifiable 
Information (PII) that would allow us to contact him, such as his name 
or mobile phone number, the user shall be free to provide such 
information. However:
<br>
<br>
</font><ul>
<li><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">If you share your PII over an open format (for example, over social 
networks), the information we obtained will not be protected by this 
privacy policy.</font></li>
<li><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">The PII will not include any type of information collected by the 
application by any means other than this application which contains the 
privacy policy. This means that the information collected anyplace else 
other than on this application will not be protected by this Privacy 
Policy. It is worth noting that, in any case the app were to offer links
 to other applications, we shall not be liable for the content, activity
 or information contained therein.</font></li>
</ul><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">
The following shall be considered Personal Information:<br><br>
</font><ul>
<li><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">Demographic information such as age or birthdate, nationality, educational level, sex, interests or characteristics.</font></li>
<li><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">User information such as the username or password, confidential 
replies to certain security questions, or similar information that 
enables us to uniquely identify your account or authenticate it before 
providing personal information about the user account.</font></li>
</ul>
<font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;"><br>
Most of these data may be obtained when the app offers a social login 
functionality, and the user accepts such a login in the app by using a 
social account. In some cases, the app automatically logs into the 
user’s social account associated with the device, and the user accepts 
to perform such a login by using this app.<br>
<br>
<br>
</font></h3><h3><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">3. What happens with the information we collect from minors?</font></h3><h3><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">
This application does not collect personal information from children 
under 13 years old. We take the privacy of minors seriously, and 
encourage the parents to play an active role in their children’s online 
education at all times. Children under 13 should not install our 
application on any device of their belonging, and if they do, it will be
 under the full responsibility of their parents or guardians. In case we
 obtain personal information from a child under 13 years old, we shall 
take measures to erase the information supplied from our server. In case
 the content of this application has been rated as suitable for children
 under 13, it should be installed exclusively on devices belonging to 
the parents, guardians, or any other person over 13 years old. If the 
application were to request personal information at any time, children 
under 13 should never enter such information.<br>
<br><br>
</font></h3><h3><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">4. How do we collect personal information?</font></h3><h3><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">

</ul>
<font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;"><br>
</font></h3><h3><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">6. Who do we share the information with?</font></h3><h3><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">
<br>
This application may share your information (in some cases), your PII and user information in the following situations:<br>
<br>
</font><ul>
<li><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">When the app is monetized via advertisements, advertisement networks
 and/or the advertisers provide advertisements that may require certain 
user or device information from the user in order to offer the most 
appropriate advertisement, or that which may interest him the most.</font></li>
<li><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">When we hire companies to perform and optimise marketing campaigns 
or advertisements and manage and study consumer data. These companies 
are authorized to obtain just the PII and user information that is 
strictly necessary in order to accomplish the task entrusted to them, 
being completely forbidden the use of any type of information for any 
means other than that which was agreed upon. They have also agreed to 
store the confidential information in a secure location. In case this 
application employs an advertisement network, such network is required 
to agree not to make fraudulent use of the data granted for the regular 
performance of their activities.</font></li>
<li><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">When we employ independent advertisement networks to display our 
application’s advertising banner when visiting third party websites. In 
order to make it more efficient, the advertisement network may use and 
incorporate into your device certain technology, such as cookies, in 
order to collect non-personal information from you when you visit our 
application. This information is used to display advertisements 
involving goods and services that best suit your interests when visiting
 other websites.</font></li>
</ul><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">
We often evaluate (sometimes with the assistance of outsourced 
companies) how our online content and services are performing. The 
information disclosed for this purpose will remain at the company’s 
server and will be limited to use for professional purposes. Under no 
circumstance the PII or the user information shall be shared except for 
the purposes mentioned above.<br>
<br>
When disclosure of information is required by law, or is targeted at 
protecting application security, this application has the right to 
disclose any information collected, no matter when such information was 
collected. We will just perform such an information disclosure when 
permitted or required by law, or when we consider there are motives that
 are in good faith: (I) in order to protect your security, even that of 
your property, (ii) to protect the security of your applications or 
third parties, and (iii) to enforce the terms of use, updates or 
promotions.<br>
<br><br>
</font></h3><h3><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">7.  Will there be third parties who collect information from your applications?</font></h3><h3><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">
<br>
There are certain situations where a third party may collect information
 about the application. This app uses third-party libraries that offer 
certain features: analysis tools, communication tools, social networks, 
advertisers, etc.<br>
<br>
</font><ul>
<li><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">Analysis tools: in order to improve the application, we sometimes 
use tools that analyse the behaviour of users. In this way, we can 
better learn which parts of the application are more important and which
 need to be improved.</font></li>
<li><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">Communication tools: in case we need to communicate with users at 
any time, we integrate third-party tools that provide such a 
communication, whether via push notifications, e-mails, in-app alerts, 
etc.</font></li>
<li><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">Social networks: if your app connects to any social network at any 
time, it will request your authorization. Once the connection has been 
authorized, the social network shall be able to access certain 
information.</font></li>
<li><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">Advertising networks: in case this app were to show advertisements, 
they normally originate from advertising networks that connect with the 
advertisers. These networks need certain information in order to offer 
the most appropriate ad to you.</font></li>
</ul>
<font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;"><br>
This application reserves the right to provide certain user information 
to companies who collaborate with us, or to software developers who 
provide some app feature. We provide this type of access to such 
companies with the purpose of generating interest in our products among 
the members with whom we have some form of agreement, so as to be able 
to offer the kind of product we offer to you and your friends. The 
information collected by us shall be treated as per the terms of this 
Privacy Policy, but the use of the information by a third party shall be
 treated as per their own standards. This application does not guarantee
 that the other party complies with its security policy.<br>
<br>
<br>
</font></h3><h3><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">8. What kind of security measures do we take to safeguard your personal information?</font></h3><h3><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">
Safety and confidentiality of your information are extremely important 
for us. Therefore, we have technical, administrative and physical 
security measures with the purpose of protecting your personal 
information against unauthorized access and fraudulent use. We also 
periodically revise our security system in order to incorporate 
technological novelties and updating methods. However, in spite of our 
efforts, no security measure is completely perfect or infallible.<br>
<br>
You can also play an important role in keeping your information stored 
securely. If you are requested to create a unique password in order to 
restrict access to your account, choose a password that is difficult to 
find out by other users, and be careful not to disclose it to anyone. It
 is your responsibility to keep your password and account information at
 all times. If you use a public or shared mobile device, never opt to 
save your user and always close your account’s session once you no 
longer use the device.<br>
<br>
Lastly, in regards to the companies that have an agreement in place with
 this application, we require them to accept to protect our 
confidentiality, integrity and security terms over any personal 
information we disclose to them. When your personal information is 
disclosed or simultaneously collected by a third party as mentioned 
above, it will either be obvious to you considering the context (such as
 the appearance of a third party on the phone’s screen), or you will be 
notified when the personal information is requested. Furthermore, you 
will be given the opportunity to accept or decline these kinds of 
practices before they begin. As set forth in section 3 of this Privacy 
Policy, we do not collect personal information of minor children under 
13 years old, and we inform them that under no circumstance should they 
use our tool. In this manner, this application shall not disclose 
information collected from children under 13 to any company that has 
signed a collaboration agreement.<br>
<br>
In case we detected that some of our technological partners endangered 
your integrity or used your information to perform any illegal action, 
we shall take the proper measures to sever the relationship with such a 
provider.
<br>
<br><br>
</font></h3><h3><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">9. How can you make an inquiry or send us comments about our privacy policy?</font></h3><h3><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">
If you have any sort of inquiry or wish to contact us in order to 
clarify any matter, please send us an e-mail at the developer’s address,
 which you will find at the website where you downloaded this app.<br>
<br><br>
</font></h3><h3><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">10. ¿Cómo sabrá usted si modificamos nuestra Política de privacidad?</font></h3><h3><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">
This application reserves the right to modify this privacy policy at any
 time, even though such a revision is not commonplace. Any policy change
 will usually be accompanied by an update in the application’s version. 
At the beginning of these policies you can find the version number and 
the date when they have been revised. In case we carry out a material 
change in the way we collect, use or share personal information, we 
shall add such changes to a new version of these policies.<br>
<br><br>
</font></h3><h3><font color="#000000" style="font-weight: normal;">11. Aclaraciones respecto al uso del ID de publicidad de Android</font></h3><h3><span style="font-weight: normal;"><font color="#000000">
Version 4.0 of Google Play services has introduced new APIs and an 
identifier code (ID) that analysis and advertisement providers may use. 
The terms of use of these APIs and this ID are detailed below:
<br>
<br>
<u>Use.</u> The advertising identifier  is used for advertising and user
 analysis purposes. The state of the option to  disable advertisement 
based on user interests
must be checked in each access to the ID.<br>
<br>
<u>Association with personally identifiable information or other identifiers.</u>
 The advertising identifier is not connected to personally identifiable 
information or associated with any persistent device identifier (for 
example, SSAID, MAC address or IMEI) without explicit consent of the 
user.<br>
<br>
<u>Respecting users' selections.</u> After reset, a new advertising 
identifier is not connected to a previous advertising identifier or data
 derived from a previous advertising identifier without the explicit 
consent of the user. Additionally, an option to disable advertisement 
based on user interests is offered. If a user has enabled this setting, 
the advertising identifier for creating user profiles for advertising 
purposes or for targeting users with interest-based advertising is not 
used. Allowed activities include contextual advertising, frequency 
capping, conversion tracking, reporting and fraud detection and 
security.<br>
<br>
<u>Abiding by the terms of use.</u> The advertising identifier may only 
be used in accordance with these terms, including the use by any party 
that you may share it with during your business activities. Beginning 
August 1<sup>st</sup>, 2014, all updates and new applications uploaded 
to the Play Store must use the advertising ID (when available on a 
device) in lieu of any other device identifier with advertising 
purposes.</font><br></span></h3></div><div class="inner"><br></div><div class="inner"><br></div></div></div>
